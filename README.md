# 📖Sumary:
This project is the result of a collaborative effort between me and [MOHCINE GHALMI](https://github.com/Mohcine-Ghalmi)

MiniRT is a computer graphics project that tackles challenges in ray tracing, specifically incorporating features such as reflection, refraction, textures, multithreading, and supersampling. The project involves rendering realistic images by simulating the behavior of light rays as they interact with surfaces in a scene.

Reflection and refraction in MiniRT allow surfaces to exhibit realistic reflective and refractive properties, enhancing the visual quality of rendered images. Textures add another layer of realism by applying detailed patterns to surfaces, creating a more visually appealing and varied environment.

The implementation of multithreading in MiniRT optimizes performance by parallelizing the rendering process. This ensures efficient utilization of available resources, resulting in faster rendering times.

Supersampling is a technique employed in MiniRT to reduce aliasing artifacts by sampling multiple points within a pixel and averaging their values. This improves the overall image quality by providing smoother and more accurate representations of the scene.
